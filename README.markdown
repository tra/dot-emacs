# Tom's .emacs.d directory

I just forked the emacs-starter-kit and made my own changes.   If you want to use mine, then do this:

	$ mv .emacs.d .emacs.d.orig
	$ git clone git://github.com/tra/dot-emacs.git .emacs.d

For it to work properly, you may need to update some of your packages using 'M-x package'. 

If you want to use the original, go to [http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/](http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/) and follow the directions there.
